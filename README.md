# 🚀 Cost-Optimized CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, GitHub Actions & AWS EC2

## Summary

Includes automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Docker → GHCR → EC2), automated EC2 scheduling (10:00–23:00 IST via EventBridge + SSM), and a stable public endpoint via Elastic IP for reliable deployments and a low monthly cost footprint.

---

This project demonstrates a **production-ready, cost-optimized CI/CD pipeline** using:

- **Docker** for containerized deployments  
- **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD  
- **AWS EC2 (t4g.micro)** as the deployment server  
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** for image storage  

The goal is to build, push, and deploy applications to EC2 **automatically on every push to `main`**, with minimal cost and maximum reliability.

## 🌐 Live Deployment

(Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions CI/CD)

# 📦 Features

- 🔄 Fully automated **CI + CD pipeline**
- 🐳 Dockerized application for consistent deployments
- 🔐 Secure SSH-based deployment to EC2
- 🚀 Auto-pull & restart container on EC2
- ♻️ `--restart always` ensures app stays up 24×7
- 💰 **Cost optimized** (~₹300-350/month on AWS without free-tier)
- ⏱️ **Automated EC2 scheduling** using EventBridge + SSM
→ Instance starts automatically at 10:00 AM IST
→ Instance stops automatically at 11:00 PM IST
→ Saves runtime costs while keeping daily availability
- 🌐 **Elastic IP attached**
→ Public IP never changes, even when EC2 stops/starts
→ Live link stays constant
→ CI/CD deployments always target the same server

# 🧰 Components

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Builds Docker image, pushes to GHCR, deploys to EC2 |
| **GitHub Container Registry** | Stores Docker images securely |
| **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** | Runs the application container |
| **Docker Engine** | Executes the app inside a container |
| **SSH Key Authentication** | Secure connection for CD |
| **Elastic IP** | Provides a permanent static IP for the app |
| **EventBridge + SSM Automation** | Automatically starts/stops the instance daily |
